# Solar System With Python
This is a Python program I wrote to simulate the solar system with 79 lines of code.

# Required modules
tkinter, math, time
# Why only 4 planets?
Including them all in the animation will make the inner planets nearly invisible.
# Disclaimer
This simulation is not 100% accurate. I made this project for visual purposes and to improve myself in Python.
